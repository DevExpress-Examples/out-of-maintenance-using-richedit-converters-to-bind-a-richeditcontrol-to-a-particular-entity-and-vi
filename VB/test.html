The <b>XtraPrinting Library</b> is our 100% C# data rendering and visualization system, built specifically for <u>Visual Studio .NET</u> and designed to bring your User Interface to the printed page. When you start using the XtraPrinting Library, you will be able to print the contents of advanced visual controls such as the <span style="font-size:large;">XtraGrid</span> and <span style="color:Blue;">XtraTreeList</span> with ease - without any hassle, and offer your end-users a nearly unlimited series of "reports" without actually having to create a single one using a traditional report writer.
